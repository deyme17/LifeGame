# Life Game

A simple cellular automaton based on Conway's Game of Life (using Pygame).

## About
Cellular automata are grid-based systems where each cell changes state based on its neighbors.  
Conway's Game of Life is a famous example, with simple rules that lead to complex patterns.

This version allows:
- Custom birth/survival rules (e.g., B3/S23)
- Adjustable simulation speed
- Interactive grid editing (mouse)
